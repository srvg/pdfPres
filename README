PDFPRES(1)              Dual head PDF presenter             PDFPRES(1)



NAME
       pdfpres - Dual head PDF presenter

SYNOPSIS
       pdfpres  [-w]  [-n] [-s slides] [-c cache] [-N notes] [-T] [-C]
       [-V] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       pdfpres is a presentation program for  PDF  files.  It  uses  a
       “dual  head”-layout: One window shows the previous, current and
       next slides while another window only shows the current  slide.
       That additional window can be moved to an external screen (such
       as a beamer).  Thus, you can present your slides  on  a  beamer
       while keeping an eye on what's coming up next.

OPTIONS
       -s slides
              This  parameter  allows  you  to specify how many slides
              before/after the current slide you wish to see,  i.e.  3
              means “preview the next 3 slides while still showing the
              previous 3 slides”. The default is 1.

              Attention: It is recommended to set the number of slides
              not greater than 2 unless you have a large screen with a
              high resolution.

       -c cache
              Specify the number of slides that can be cached/pre-ren‐
              dered.

              Be  aware,  though,  that  this  value will always be at
              least “number of pdf viewports” × 2. This is  needed  so
              that  we  can  pre-render the current and next slide for
              each viewport. Hence, switching to the next  (or  previ‐
              ous) slides will always be instant.

       -w     Enables  wrapping.  When  you're  on  the last slide and
              wrapping is enabled, switching to the “next” slide actu‐
              ally switches to the very first slide.

       -n     Enables “note control”. The number of the slide which is
              currently shown will be written to stdout. You can  pipe
              this  information  to another program. That'll allow you
              to do fancy things.

       -N notes
              Allows you to specify a file with  notes  that  will  be
              loaded  on startup.  The file has to be in the same for‐
              mat that pdfpres uses when saving notes.

       -C     Forces the timer to be a clock, so it shows the  current
              time.

       -T     Opposite of -C, forces the timer to be a timer.

       -v     Show current version of pdfpres.

       Command  line arguments take precedence over permanent settings
       (see CONFIGURATION).

KEYS
       Full customization of all keybinds is planned.  Currently,  you
       can only use the following fixed keybinds to control pdfpres:

       Use the cursor keys to navigate. Space, Return, Right, Down and
       Page Down also go the next slide, Left, Up and Page  Up  go  to
       the  previous  slide.  Left  Mouse  switches to the next slide,
       Right Mouse switches to the previous slide.

       p switches to “fit page”, this is the default.

       w switches to “fit width” mode,  h  switches  to  “fit  height”
       mode.

       F5  emulates “Start Presentation” like in LibreOffice. That is,
       fullscreen is activated and the timer is started.

       F6 forces a full refresh.

       Esc and q quit the program. If q_exits_fullscreen is  set  (see
       CONFIGURATION),  those  keys only end fullscreen mode. You then
       need a second keypress to exit pdfpres.

       Sometimes you need  to  browse  your  slides  but  that  would,
       inevitably, confuse the audience. So fixating the current slide
       on the beamer while still allowing free navigation in the  pre‐
       view  window  should  be quite handy. Lock it by pressing l and
       unlock it with a capital L.

       In locked mode, press J  to  jump  to  the  currently  selected
       slide.

       Alternatively,  you  can  press  b  or  . (period) to blank the
       beamer window — it'll turn into a plain black window.  Pressing
       b  or  . again will return the current slide. Note: Even with a
       blank beamer window you can still browse your slides.

       To switch to fullscreen, press f. You could also use your  win‐
       dow  manager  for this purpose. That is, Alt + F11 would do the
       same in Xfce. The beamer window is moved to the current monitor
       (that  is,  that  monitor  the  mouse  pointer is currently on)
       before fullscreen mode is activated.

       s starts the timer, pauses it and continues if paused. r resets
       the timer.

       c toggles cursor visibility in presentation window.

       i enters note edit mode, Esc leaves note edit mode.

       Type  a  number and then G or Return to jump to the appropriate
       slide.

CONFIGURATION
       pdfpres writes all of its configuration  variables  to  ~/.con‐
       fig/pdfpres/config.xml on exit. This file will look like this:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <config>
            <initial_fit_mode v="2"/>
            <slide_context v="1"/>
            <do_wrapping v="0"/>
            <do_notectrl v="0"/>
            <cache_max v="32"/>
            <font_notes v="Sans 12"/>
            <font_timer v="Sans 35"/>
            <q_exits_fullscreen v="0"/>
            <timer_is_clock v="0"/>
            <stop_timer_on_fs v="0"/>
       </config>

       For  now, you're supposed to directly edit this file except for
       font settings. If you change fonts inside pdfpres, they'll  get
       saved automatically.

       initial_fit_mode
              Accepts  0,  1 or 2 meaning “fit width”, “fit height” or
              “fit page”.

       slide_context
              Equivalent to the -s ... parameter.

       cache_max
              Equivalent to the -c ... parameter.

       do_wrapping
              Equivalent to the -w parameter. 1 enables  wrapping  and
              everything else disables it.

       do_notectrl
              Equivalent  to  the -n parameter. 1 enables note control
              and everything else disables it.

       font_notes
       font_timer
              Set the font for notes and timer. This string  will  get
              parsed  by  pango_font_description_from_string,  so  you
              might want to have a look at the GNOME API documentation
              (http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/unstable/pango-
              Fonts.html#pango-font-description-from-string)  to   see
              what's possible.

       q_exits_fullscreen
              If  this  is set to 1, then pressing q or Esc only exits
              fullscreen mode and you'll need a second keypress  on  q
              or  Esc to exit the program. If it's 0 (default), then a
              single keypress on q or Esc always quits pdfpres (unless
              you're currently editing slide notes).

       timer_is_clock
              By  default  (0),  a timer is shown. You can start it or
              stop it.  However, it's sometimes more useful to see the
              current  real  time.  This  can  be done by setting this
              option to 1.

       stop_timer_on_fs
              By default (0), a running timer  keeps  running  if  you
              exit fullscreen mode. On some setups, however, it may be
              required for the timer to stop when fullscreen  mode  is
              being left. To do so, set this option to 1.

OLD FORMAT FOR SLIDE NOTES
       If  you already used an old version of pdfpres that didn't save
       the notes in XML, you can use the converter script to transform
       those notes into XML:

       $ ./legacy-notes-converter.py notes.txt > notes.xml

       The resulting file notes.xml can be read in pdfpres.

       Be  aware  that  this script expects a file encoded with UTF-8.
       Use the editor of your choice or recode to transform  any  non-
       UTF-8  files (you may adjust the input encoding) before you run
       the converter:

       $ recode LATIN1..UTF8 < notes.txt > notes-utf8.txt

FILES
       ~/.config/pdfpres/config.xml
              Local per user configuration.
